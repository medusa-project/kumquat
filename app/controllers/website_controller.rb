  # Checks whether the client has passed a CAPTCHA test. Three form fields are
  # checked:
  #
  # 1. A hash of the salted correct answer to a question, e.g. "what's 5 + 3?"
  # 2. The answer to the question above, provided by the client, whose salted
  #    hash is expected to match #1
  # 3. Another irrelevant field that is hidden via CSS and expected to remain
  #    unfilled (the "honeypot technique")
  #
  # The form data is expected to arrive via XHR. In the handler, check the
  # return value and return immediately if it is `false`.

  # This method works in conjunction with {ApplicationHelper#captcha} and the
